 # Analog Clock

## Overview
This is a fully functional **analog clock** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock shows real-time movement of the hour, minute, and second hands, mimicking a real analog wall clock.

## Features
- Real-time working analog clock
- Rotating hour, minute, and second hands
- Smooth hand movement based on actual time
- Fully responsive design
- Clean and minimal UI

## How It Works
- The clock face is built using HTML and styled with CSS
- JavaScript is used to fetch the current time using `Date()` object
- The hour, minute, and second hands are rotated using CSS transforms based on the calculated angles
- `setInterval()` updates the hand positions every second to keep the time accurate

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To create the clock structure and hands  
- **CSS**: To style the clock and apply positioning and transforms  
- **JavaScript**: For calculating time and updating hand rotations dynamically
